    <h1>Afghanistan on brink of collapse, Taliban fighters surviving on donation: Report</h1>
    <p id="para1">The United Nations said on Tuesday that four million Afghans are facing "a food emergency" 
        and the majority live in rural areas where $36 million is urgently needed for the coming months 
        to ensure the planting of winter wheat, feed for livestock, and cash assistance for vulnerable families.</p>
    <p>Since its takeover by the Taliban, Afghanistan has been facing cash crunch, 
        with global aids freezing and daily limits set on withdrawal from bank accounts.
         Now, a report in New York Post has claimed that most of the Taliban fighters have not received money 
         in months.
